## Tips for Quality Screenshots

- Use dark mode (better appearance)
- Select an interesting race (e.g., Monza, Silverstone)
- For telemetry, choose contrasting drivers (e.g., Verstappen vs Hamilton)
- Ensure all charts are loaded
- Screenshot the entire browser window (or just the app content)

## Alternative Tools

If you don't want to take your own screenshots, you can use tools like:
- Windows Snipping Tool (Win + Shift + S)
- ShareX (free screenshot tool)
- Or use GIF animations in README with ScreenToGif
